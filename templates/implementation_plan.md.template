# {{FEATURE_NAME}} - Implementation Plan

## Overview

{{BRIEF_OVERVIEW}}

---

## Phase 1: Codebase Exploration

<!--
Exploration steps discover the codebase structure and document findings.
Each step should focus on ONE specific area.
Findings are documented under each step during execution.
-->

- [ ] **Explore {{AREA_1}}**
  - Find where {{COMPONENT}} is defined/implemented
  - Identify the key files and their responsibilities
  - Note relevant line numbers for later reference

  **Findings:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

- [ ] **Explore {{AREA_2}}**
  - Understand how {{PATTERN}} works in this codebase
  - Find existing similar implementations to follow as patterns

  **Findings:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

---

## Phase 2: Implementation - {{COMPONENT_1}}

<!--
Implementation steps should be small and atomic.
Each step should touch 1-3 files maximum.
Provide specific, actionable instructions.
-->

- [ ] **{{SPECIFIC_TASK_1}}**
  - {{DETAILED_INSTRUCTION_1}}
  - {{DETAILED_INSTRUCTION_2}}

  **Implementation:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

- [ ] **{{SPECIFIC_TASK_2}}**
  - {{DETAILED_INSTRUCTION}}

  **Implementation:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

---

## Phase 3: Implementation - {{COMPONENT_2}}

- [ ] **{{TASK}}**
  - {{INSTRUCTION}}

  **Implementation:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Wiring

<!--
Connect the components together.
Wire up event handlers, data flow, etc.
-->

- [ ] **{{INTEGRATION_TASK}}**
  - {{INSTRUCTION}}

  **Implementation:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Verification

<!--
Always include testing steps.
Build, run, and verify the implementation works.
-->

- [ ] **Build and verify compilation**
  - Build command: `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}`
  - Verify no compilation errors

  **Result:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

- [ ] **Manual testing**
  - {{TEST_SCENARIO}}
  - Expected behavior: {{EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}}

  **Result:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

- [ ] **Edge case verification**
  - {{EDGE_CASE_TEST}}

  **Result:**
  <!-- Claude fills this in during execution -->

```

### Key Files
<!-- Populated during exploration phase -->

### Design Decisions
